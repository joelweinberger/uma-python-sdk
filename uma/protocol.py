    1. If the sender wants the receiver wants to receive a specific amount in their receiving
    currency, then this field should be the same as `receiving_currency_code`. This is useful
    for cases where the sender wants to ensure that the receiver receives a specific amount

    for some goods or services in a foreign currency.

    2. If the sender has a specific amount in their own currency that they would like to send,
    then this field should be left as `None` to indicate that the amount is in millisatoshis.
    This will lock the sent amount on the sender side, and the receiver will receive the
    equivalent amount in their receiving currency. NOTE: In this scenario, the sending VASP
    *should not* pass the sending currency code here, as it is not relevant to the receiver.
